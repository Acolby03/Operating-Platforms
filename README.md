Reflection on The Gaming Room Project

The Gaming Room was my client for this project. They had a game called Draw It or Lose It that was originally only on Android, and they wanted me to design a system that could expand the game to work on multiple platforms.
They needed something that could run multiple game sessions at once, handle different players and teams, and keep the experience smooth and reliable.

What I think I did well was breaking down the requirements and explaining how they connected to the actual design. I made sure the business side and the technical side matched up, which made everything more organized and
easier to follow.

Working through the design document was really helpful because it made me think everything through before coding. Instead of just jumping in, I had to lay out diagrams, requirements, and system details. Having that plan in
place gave me a clear idea of what the system needed to do and how to build it.

If I could go back and change something, I’d probably redo some of my diagrams. They worked fine, but I know I could make them look cleaner and more professional if I spent more time on consistency and formatting. That would
make it easier for anyone reading them to understand.

When it came to user needs, I kept focusing on what the players and the admins would expect from the system. I made sure the design allowed for scalability and was simple to use. Thinking about the user’s needs is so
important because, at the end of the day, they’re the ones who have to use it. A system can be technically strong, but if it doesn’t work for the people using it, then it’s not a good design.

My approach to designing software is to always start with the requirements and then move into diagrams and system planning before worrying about code. In the future, I want to keep doing that but also add more chances for
feedback along the way, so I can adjust the design early if needed. That way, the final product will line up even better with what the client and users are expecting.
